The goals of this game engine:
    //create a window that works (minimize, exit, maximize, etc).
        research how Windows interfacing works to create windows and use them
    Display an image on a window.
        research how to send graphical signals to gpu and display stuff
    (maybe jump to optional proj)
    Output audio to device.
        generate audio signals, create and modify them, output them
    Take user input from keyboard and mouse.
        interfacing with windows again to get user input and interrupts 
    update screen n times per second, implement counter or clock or similar device to control timing of programs.
        implement clock and counter to control the timing of the screen updating to create an FPS
    Implement some preservation of state, aka storing and retreiving data
	be able to load a save file, or retain data after closing program

    Someday far future:
        make a simple game
        render scenes (simple 2d)
        full documentation and github version control etiquette
        create an executable made from the game

(optional mini project): make an MS paint clone to help develop our understanding of some of the above goals.
